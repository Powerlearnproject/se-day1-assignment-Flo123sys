Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It's the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. It's important as it aides in enabling creation of software applications that power up aspects of modern life e.g entertainment and health.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Development of programming languages eg C.
2.Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.
3.Advent of structured programming in the 70s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirement-gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2.Design- creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface.
3.Implementation-writing code and building the software.
4.Testing- testing the software to see if it meets the needs.
5.Deployment-releasing the software to clients.
6.Maintenance-providing ongoing support and updates to clients softwares. 
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is sequential in approach and has distinct phases thus rigid and is best used when there is a fixed timeline and budget whereas agile methodology is iterative and incremental in approach thus flexible thus best used where there no fixed timelines and where client's needs keep changing

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- writes the codes and implements the software.
Quality assurance engineer-ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project manager-oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated develpment environments (IDEs) help in writing,testing and debugging the code eg visual studio and Eclipse.
Version  control systems (VCSs) help to track changes in source code and co-ordinate work among team members eg Git and Sub version.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements can be overcome by using  agile methidologies.
Technical debts from shortcuts can be solved by regular reassessment  of project.
Tight deadlines can be solved by proritization of tasks to avoid delays.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit testing-testing of individual components or modules of softwaree.
2.Intergration-testing of interaction between differernt components or subsystems.
3.System-testing of the entire system as a whole.
4.Acceptancee-testing against the user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the crafting of questions or statements to get best possible responses from AI models. Its important as it aides one to get clear and specific responses from AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt-Give me a summary of to my sibling.
Improved-Give me a summary of the book "To my sibling" by Freya winters.
The improved prompt is more effective as it is clear and specific what you want and by who thus defining it more while the vague one didn't specify what exactly it wanted and by who.
